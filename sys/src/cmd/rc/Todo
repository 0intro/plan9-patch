	rewrite to give unicode support

	there is an underlying assumption in haventfork.c that argv0 can 
	be used to envoke rc again without looking down the path.
	This may or may not be true but I will leave it for now.

	rework #! handling - code is a bit ugly.

	whatis doesn't walk the path and probably should so
	it claims not to know about things which do really exist.

	exec (rc command) doesn't work - is there any way to emulate this
	if is it all too horrid to even think of.
