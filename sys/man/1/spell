.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Spell
looks up words from the named
.I files
(standard input default)
in a spelling list and places
possible misspellings\(emwords 
not sanctioned there\(emon the standard output.
.PP
.I Spell
ignores constructs of
.IR troff (1)
and its standard preprocessors.
It understands these options:
.TP
.B -b
Check British spelling.
.TP
.B -v
Print all words not literally in the spelling list, with
derivations.
.TP
.B -x
Print on standard error, marked with
.LR = ,
every stem as it is looked up in the spelling list,
along with its affix classes.
.PP
.I Aspell
is similar to
.I spell
except that it prepends to each line printed the address
of the first occurrence of the word in the input, in a format
suitable for plumbing to acme or sam. For compatibility, it
accepts the same arguments as
.IR spell ,
although
.B -v
is ignored. It must be run within
.IR acme (1).
.PP
.I Sprog
is the actual spelling checker. It expects one word
per line on standard input. It takes the same arguments as
.I spell
(which simply passes them through), plus
.B -a
to indicate its input will have the acme-style
addresses prepended.
.PP
As a matter of policy, 
.I sprog
does not admit multiple spellings of the same word.
Variants that follow general rules are preferred
over those that don't, even when the unruly spelling is
more common.
Thus, in American usage, `modelled', `sizeable', and `judgment' are
rejected in favor of `modeled', `sizable', and `judgement'.
Agglutinated variants are shunned: `crewmember' and `backyard'
cede to `crew member' and  `back yard' (noun) or `back-yard' 
(adjective).

.SH BUGS
The heuristics of
.IR deroff (1)
used to excise formatting information are imperfect.
.PP
The spelling list's coverage is uneven;
in particular biology, medicine, and chemistry, and
perforce proper names,
not to mention languages other than English,
are covered very lightly.
