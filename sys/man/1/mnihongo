.SH DESCRIPTION
Mnihongo is a 
.IR troff (1)
post-processor that 
catches Unicode characters that might be Japanese,
looks them up in a font file (currently
.B /lib/font/bit/pelm/unicode.9x24.font\fR) 
to get the
bits, converts that to PostScript, and dumps that
in the output.
.PP
Widths are taken from troff font Jp, which has at
best a simple approximation to the truth.
.PP
The program itself is normally called implicitly
by loading the troff macro package -mnihongo, which
does a .pi command.
