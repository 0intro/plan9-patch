.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cec
command uses raw ethernet to connect to a CEC
server for console access.  All clients share the same session.  
Coraid appliances and Coraid Plan 9 kernels can currently be
CEC servers.
.PP
A
.I cec
process starts by probing the specified network interface
for available CEC servers.  The default is
.I /net/ether0 .
If the server is specified with the
.BR -b ,
.BR -h ,
or
.B -s
.B -s
flag, the connection will
proceed immediately upon discovery of the first CEC server
with the specified address.  Otherwise, a selection prompt
will be displayed showing the discovered CEC servers 
available for communication.  Unless the
.B -p
flag is specified, 
.I cec
exits if no matching servers are found.

The selection prompt accepts
.TP
.I number
Connect to server
.I number
(from the first column),
.TP
.B p
Probe the interface again, and
.TP
.B q
Quit.
.PP
Note the selection number is not the shelf address but the
.IR cec -generated
sequence number printed in the leftmost column.

Once connected to a cec server, entering the escape sequence
will drop the user into an escape prompt where the user may
type 'q' to quit the connection, 'i' to send the escape sequence
across the connection, or '.' to continue the connection.
The escape sequence is printed on connection.
.SS Options
.TP 1i
.B -d
Output debugging information.
.TP
.BI -c " esc"
Set the escape caracter to
.BI ctl -
.IR esc .
The default setting is
.BR ctl -\e.
.TP
.BI -e "ea"
Connect to the server with ethernet address
.IR ea .  This option implies
.IR -p .
.TP
.BI -h "host"
Connect to the server named
.IR host .
Note this name may not be the same as the value of
.LR /dev/sysname .
.TP
.B -p
Persistence.  Continue trying to connect even if
there are no matching servers.  This is useful when
connecting to a cpu server before it boots.
.TP
.BI -s " shelf"
Connect to the server at shelf address
.IR shelf .
.SH NOTES
If the
.BI -e ,
.BI -s ,
or
.B -h
flags are used cec will exit upon closing the connection.
Otherwise, cec will return to the selection prompt upon connection
close.

.IR cec (3) .
.SH BUGS
The CEC protocol should be integrated with the console server.
The arbitration between the keyboard and network is suboptimal.
.PP
Early boot information and very late crash information from servers
may be lost due to timing quirks.
